# Advent of Code 2024

This year i hope to try out Advent of Code for the first time.

This repository is meant to hold my solutions (or attempts) to the given problems.

I'm most profictient in Python and will probably start out there, but I'm also interested in leraning Rust, so maybe a few attempts of that will also appear.
